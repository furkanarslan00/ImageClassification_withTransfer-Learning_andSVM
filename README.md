# EfficientNet-B0 + SVM Image Classification Project

## Overview

This project focuses on image classification by combining **deep feature extraction** using the **EfficientNet-B0** model and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classification. The dataset is augmented with various transformations to enhance model performance and generalization.

## Project Features

- **EfficientNet-B0** is used as a feature extractor.
- **SVM classifier** is trained on the extracted features.
- **Data augmentation** is applied 10x per image to enrich training data.
- **Average test accuracy** achieved: **96%**.
- Custom dataset loader supports both original and augmented images.
- Experiments are repeated 5 times with different train-test splits.

## Dataset

The dataset must be organized in ImageFolder format under the path:

/dataset/
   â”œâ”€â”€ class_1/
   â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ image1.jpg
   â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ image2.jpg
   â”‚    â””â”€â”€ ...
   â”œâ”€â”€ class_2/
   â”‚    â””â”€â”€ ...
   â””â”€â”€ ...

All images are resized to 224x224 and normalized to match the input requirements of EfficientNet.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
PyTorch
torchvision
scikit-learn
numpy
PIL

Install dependencies with:

pip install torch torchvision scikit-learn numpy pillow
